To scrape you must provide 3 options in the following format:

`rpscrape [region or course] [year or range] [code]`

list regions with `rpscrape regions` or even `rpscrape regions gb` or `rpscape regions france`
list courses with `rpscrape course`

year can be `rpscrape gb 2017`
range can be `rpscrape ire 2017-2018`

code is either `flat` or `jumps`
